											<h3>Who I am</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hello there! My name is Nyx and I'm a fourth year University of Calgary student in the faculty of Kinesiology majoring in Leadership and Coaching. I transferred into the program at the start of my second year after spending my first two semesters in the Cellular, Mollecular and Microbial Biology program. Beyond being a student, I'm a parkour coach at Breathe Parkour, a certified personal trainer and strength and conditioning coach, and an artist. </p>
											<h3>What I'm doing</h3>
										<p>As I mentioned, I'm currently working as a parkour coach for Breathe. Most of my work is in program design and group coaching. Some of my most recent projects are the Littles and Advanced Summer Camp programs at Breathe. The Littles program is a parkour class I co-designed for kids aged 3-5. The program focuses on the development of fundamental movement skills in a parkour setting through skills-based games and adventures. It has been one of Breathe's most succesful programs and has seen 400% growth since its introduciton a year and a half ago. The Advanced Summer camp program is a modified program I've solo designed based on Breathe's existing summer camp model that aims to provide higher performing youth with a skills based camp which will allow them to explore more advanced concepts within the sport. I've also started working with our youngest competitive team, Breathe Elite Ember.</p>
										<p>This May, I will also be attending my first art market! I'll be vending at a table for the 2025 Punk Rock Flea Market selling original pieces alongside over 100 other amazing local artists! If you want to learn more about that you can <a href= "https://www.prfmyyc.com/" >click here.</a> I'll be selling mostly my traditional work which is primarily in coloured pencil, graphite and acrylic. If you want to see some of my work, you can look <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nyx.r.oliv/">here. </a></p>
